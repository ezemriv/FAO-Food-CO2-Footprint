6601,Land area,Country area excluding area under inland waters and coastal waters.
6602,Agriculture,"Land used for agricultural purposes, including for cultivation of crops and animal husbandry, farm buildings, etc. The total of areas under “Agricultural land” and “Farm buildings and Farmyards”."
6610,Agricultural land,Land used for cultivation of crops and animal husbandry. The total of areas under ''Cropland'' and ''Permanent meadows and pastures.''

6621,Arable land,"Land used for cultivation of crops in rotation with fallow, meadows and pastures within cycles of up to five years. The total of areas under ""Temporary crops,'' ''Temporary meadows and pastures,'' and ''Temporary fallow.'' Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not cultivated."
6630,Temporary crops,"Land used for crops with a less-than-one-year growing cycle, which must be newly sown or planted for further production after the harvest. Some crops that remain in the field for more than one year may also be considered as temporary crops e.g., asparagus, strawberries, pineapples, bananas and sugar cane.  Multiple-cropped areas are counted only once."
6633,Temporary meadows and pastures,"Land temporarily cultivated with herbaceous forage crops for mowing or pasture, as part of crop rotation periods of less than five years."
6640,Temporary fallow,"Land that is not seeded for one or more growing seasons. The maximum idle period is usually less than five years. This land may be in the form sown for the exclusive production of green manure. Land remaining fallow for too long may acquire characteristics requiring it to be reclassified, as for instance “Permanent meadows and pastures” if used for grazing or haying."
6650,Permanent crops,"Land cultivated with long-term crops which do not have to be replanted for several years (such as cocoa and coffee), land under trees and shrubs producing flowers (such as roses and jasmine), and nurseries (except those for forest trees, which should be classified under ""Forestry""). Permanent meadows and pastures are excluded from Permanent crops."
6655,Permanent meadows and pastures,"Land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops through cultivation or naturally (wild prairie or grazing land). Permanent meadows and pastures on which trees and shrubs are grown should be recorded under this heading only if the growing of forage crops is the most important use of the area. Measures may be taken to keep or increase productivity of the land (i.e., use of fertilizers, mowing or systematic grazing by domestic animals.) This class includes:• Grazing in wooded areas (agroforestry areas, for example); • Grazing in shrubby zones (heath, maquis, garigue); • Grassland in the plain or low mountain areas used for grazing: land crossed during transhumance where the animals spend a part of the year (approximately 100 days) without returning to the holding in the evening: mountain and subalpine meadows and similar; and steppes and dry meadows used for pasture."

6664,Cropland area under conventional tillage,"Cropland area on which tillage practices involve inversion (turning over) of the soil over the whole area with tillage operations including inversion tillage/ploughing using tillage tools or equipment, such as a mouldboard or disc plough or powered tillage equipment, such as a rotovator. It includes tilllage with traditional ploughs, of either wood or iron, drawn by animal power."
6665,Cropland area under conservation tillage,"Cropland area on which tillage practices leave plant residues (at least 30-35 percent) on the soil surface for erosion control and moisture conservation. Soil should normally not be inverted but only ripped. Conservation tillage includes: i) Reduced tillage/ minimum tillage, preparing the land with equipment which does not invert the soil and which causes little compaction but which leaves some ripping lines. For this reason, the soil normally remains with a good cover of residues on the surface. Reduced tillage is usually carried out with specialized tined implement, such as a ripper.ii) Strip tillage, which involves strips being tilled to receive the seed, while the soil along the intervening bands is not disturbed and remains covered with residues such as mulch.iii) Ridge tillage, which is a system of ridges and furrows. The ridges may be narrow or wide and the furrows can be parallel to the contour lines or constructed with a slight slope, depending on whether the objective is to conserve moisture or to drain excess moisture. The surface is prepared by scraping off the top of a ridge, with the crops planted into the tops of the ridges formed during cultivation of the previous crop. The soil is covered with residue between the rows until planting. The ridges can be semi-permanent or be constructed each year, which will govern the amount of residue material that remains on the surface."
6666,Cropland area under zero or no tillage,"Cropland area on which practices do not involve any tillage operations. After the seeding operation, not more than 25 percent of the soil surface is allowed to be disturbed. The soils are always covered, including for the period between harvest and sowing. The stubble is retained and the soil surface is covered by residue mulch or stubble for erosion control. Seeding/planting is done with special no-tillage/direct seeders, which are able to open a narrow slot of the soil (through soil cover), drop the seed and close the slot again. Zero tillage is carried out with implements such as direct planters or hand-jab planters. Seed can be also sown by broad casting into standing vegetation or into small holes in the ground intended for seed placement."
6774,Cropland area under protective cover,"Cropland area under a permanent structure with a roof of glass, plastic or other material, used for protecting crops against the weather, pests or diseases. Such structures may be used for growing temporary or permanent crops. It includes greenhouses, glasshouses, and shade houses. It does not include: temporary devices for short-term protection, such as plastic covering to protect against frosts; netting to protect against insects or other animals; and nurseries. If the area of land under protective cover was used for growing different crops during the reference year, it will be counted only once."
6762,Land used for aquaculture,"Land used for aquaculture facilities and fish-farming activities. Aquaculture refers to the farming of aquatic organisms: fish, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic plants, crocodiles, alligators, turtles and amphibians. Farming implying some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Land used for aquaculture facilities and fish-farming activities includes housing facilities for breeding, nursing and rearing seed of fish, invertebrates or aquatic plants to fry, fingerling or juvenile stages."
6767,Inland waters used for aquac. or holding facilities,"Inland water areas that are used for aquaculture facilities including supporting facilities. Aquaculture facilities include enclosures and pens (water areas confined by net, mesh and other barriers allowing uncontrolled water interchange), cages (open or covered enclosed structure constructed with net, mesh or any porous materials allowing natural water interchange), barrages (semi-permanent or seasonal enclosures formed by impervious man-made barriers and appropriate natural features) and rafts, ropes and stakes (raft, long lines or stakes used to culture shellfish and seaweeds)."

6714,Primary Forest,"Naturally regenerated forest of native species, where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed.Explanatory note:1. Some key characteristics of primary forests are:• they show natural forest dynamics, such as natural tree species composition, occurrence of dead wood, natural age structure and natural regeneration processes;• the area is large enough to maintain its natural characteristics; • there has been no known significant human intervention or the last significant human intervention was long enough ago to have allowed the natural species composition and processes to have become re-established."
